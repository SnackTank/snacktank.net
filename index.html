		<h2 id="yt_title">Youtube Channel</h2>
		<p>No new videos yet; I haven't posted a new video since June. I hoping that I'll post something
		before the new year, but only time will tell. I just haven't had any good video ideas as of late,
		hence the lack of videos. I've been planning a video with one of my friends for a while now,
		but I'm doubtful that we'll actually do it. There will be new videos, but I don't know when,
		and I'm not currently working on any videosâ€”probably not anytime soon.

		<h2 id="sw_title">Software</h2>
		<p>Laser Labyrinth is very much still in the works! Even though there hasen't been an
		update in the last few months, the game is still being worked on. Recently I added
		movement code to the eneimes, now they can fight back! I've also been working on a
		HD fullscreen version of the game. I don't know when I'll release it to the public,
		but now you can rest at night knowing that there will be a HD fullscreen version of
		Laser Labyrinth!</p>
