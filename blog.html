  <h1>I FINALLY made a website!</h1>
  <h3>06/13/2024</h3>
  <p>I've always been meaning to create a website but I would get stuck at the part of hosting it. But finally I solved that and created this website for everyone to enjoy! This website is not the
  most complicated website on the internet, and there's a reson why. I have-or at least plan to-Java applets on this site. And, well, Java applets haven't been supported by any major
  browsers for several years at this point. So I'll have to support older web browsers that do support Java applets, that's why the site is super simple. I hope that I'll contiune to
  support the website and make sure it doesn't end up like my Youtube Channel, where I never relase new content and it stays dead for several months at a time. More to come! (Hopfully.)</p>
