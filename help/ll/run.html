	<h1>Running issues.</h1>
	<p>This is a page to fix any errors while running the game. <br>
		The Terminal might be useful here. Windows/MacOS/Linux command:
    <em>java -jar LaserLabyrinth-aX.X.jar</em> 
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<strong>I:</strong> <br>
	Check if the jar file is in the same parent folder as the 'rsc' folder. Check that no files are missing from the 'rsc' folder. 
	<br>
	
	<strong>II:</strong> <br>
	See if Java 1.8 or higher is installed. You can do this by running a terminal command. Windows/MacOS/Linux command:
    <em>java -version</em> If you get an error saying that 'java' is not a command, or invalid, then Java is not installed.
	If you get a responce saying "Java version X.X.X" than Java is installed. Check if the version is 1.8 or higher, or the game 
	will not run!
	<br>
	
	<br>
	<strong title="OR try fixing it yourself.">If all else fails, reinstall the game!</strong>
