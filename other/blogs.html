	The long awaited Help page is finally finished. Now if anyone has an issue, they could visit the help page to get a quick solution to their ploblem. This website has been left 
	dormant for the last... SIX MONTHS. DANG, I really need to update this website more often. I wonder how many people visted this website just to think, "Dang, the last post 
	was in June, this website is dead." Anyway, I don't have any big plans for this website so the next update might even take longer to come out. Laser Labyrinth is still very much
	being worked on. I've already mentioned what I've been working on on the home page, so I won't write that all out again. I still haven't posted to my YouTube channel since I announced this website on it. One day I'll post a new video, probably in 2025 at this pace,
	and I'll finally get an upload scheude and not have several months hiatuses. I predict that the next blog post will probably be in May of 2025, lets hope that I do post before then.

	<h1>I FINALLY made a website!</h1>
	<h3>06/13/2024</h3>
	<p>I've always been meaning to create a website but I would get stuck at the part of hosting it. But finally I solved that and created this website for everyone to enjoy! This website is not the
	most complicated website on the internet, and there's a reson why. I have-or at least plan to-Java applets on this site. And, well, Java applets haven't been supported by any major
	browsers for several years at this point. So I'll have to support older web browsers that do support Java applets, that's why the site is super simple. I hope that I'll contiune to
	support the website and make sure it doesn't end up like my Youtube Channel, where I never relase new content and it stays dead for several months at a time. More to come! (Hopfully.)</p>
