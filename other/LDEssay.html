	<h1>LaserDisc are simply better</h1>
	<p style="text-indent:50px;">The LaserDisc, the 1970’s optical disc that is and still is one of the greatest formats of all time. 
	There are multiple reasons why LaserDisc are still great today, it has great quality, exclusive features and a 
	fascinating history!</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent:50px;">LaserDisc have exultant quality, however LaserDisc are 480i, you might say, 
	“That’s less than DVD!” However DVDs and even Blu-rays suffer from something called 
	compression. Compression is used when a movie cannot be on one single disc, so they 
	compress it by making the audio and video quality lower and it creates artifacts. These 
	artifacts are visual and audible and can take away from the movie experience. However 
	LaserDisc being an analog format it cannot be compressed. But you may say, “But because 
	you can’t compress, movies are on multiple disc.” That is a slight disadvantage however 
	the better video and audio make the movie experience the fullest it can! They also had 
	better masters, original film that gets printed or recorded onto a piece of media, because 
	in the early days of the DVD they were still trying to get a good master so at this time, 
	and it’s some-what still true today, LaserDisc often looked the same or even BETTER than 
	the DVD copy. They also have outstanding build quality, the sleeves never cheaped out and 
	they had beautiful artwork, the disc were printed carefully and they were never abused and 
	were taken care of. LaserDisc were often viewed as the professional format, because of 
	this they often had more or better special features. </p>
	
	<p style="text-indent:50px;">LaserDisc have outstanding special and exclusive features, and depending on the disc 
	type, had features that no ever format could ever rival. There are three main types of 
	LaserDisc, Constant Linear Velocity (CLV), Constant Angular Velocity (CAV), and Constant
	Angular Acceleration (CAA). CAV disc have the most features however CLV/CAA are more 
	common. The CAV type has many tricks up its sleeve. It can do perfect freeze frames, 
	and can do frame by frame or “slow motion” so you can reverse and slow down your 
	favorite scenes in your movie, you can’t do that with DVDs, Blu-rays or even streaming! 
	Because LaserDisc are 12 inches in diameter, the cover has beautiful artwork which many 
	moviegoers enjoy. Many special features originate on the LaserDisc, many of these features 
	were shortened or outright removed from the DVD release. One example is the original Star 
	Wars Trilogy, the movie was edited and changed from the original on the DVD release, 
	however these edits never made it to the LaserDisc release. Many people enjoy the original
	version of this film. They also have exclusive special features that never made it to DVD, 
	and depending on the master, the film was in 16:9 or widescreen. Another example is 
	Forrest Gump, even though the main film is the same on LaserDisc and DVD, it has a special 
	feature called, “Through the eyes of Forrest Gump.” This special feature was shortened 
	during a TV broadcast, this was the version that made it on the DVD release, however the 
	LaserDisc version is the unaltered and longer version. Many people, me included, love a 
	longer and more in death version of their favorite films and bonus content that might be 
	included. A lot of these special features helped LaserDisc get its place in history.</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent:50px;">LaserDisc have a special place in history because they were the first optical disc 
	format to ever reach the market. LaserDisc laid the foundation of Compact Disc, (CD),  
	Compact Disc Video, (CDV), Video Compact Disc, (VCD), Digital Versatile Disc, (DVD), 
	Blu-ray and many others! Some of these “offspring” eventually would come back and help 
	LaserDisc. One of these is the Compact Disc Video, not to be confused with Video Compact 
	Disc, which is a digital video disc format before the DVD. The CDV was born because 
	LaserDisc was failing in Europe and Philips, which was in charge of LaserDisc in Europe 
	at the time, had to do something fast. So they came up with the brilliant idea of 
	renaming the format to Compact Disc Video, so they could capture the popularity of the CD. 
	To cut a long story short, it failed, however one thing that CDV had was Digital Audio. 
	When the CDV failed the technology to add digital audio was added to LaserDisc.</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent:50px;">	LaserDisc have many reasons why they are still great even in the modern era. 
	They have great quality, exclusive features, and a fascinating history. LaserDisc are 
	and were truly the best format and way to enjoy your favorite films!</p>
